üëÅÔ∏èüíª Excited to share a demo of my latest project - a Contact Lens Virtual Try-On system built using MediaPipe and React JS!

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and everyday life, and this project allowed me to explore that passion further. With this system, users can virtually try on different contact lens styles and colors, providing them with a realistic preview before making a decision.
This project uses Google MediaPipe to detect land mark of face and from there you can find Irish . After that just fill the selected point to change you eye color.

Key features:
üîç Real-time face tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe
üé® Customizable lens styles and colors
üñºÔ∏è User-friendly interface built with React JS
üí° Seamless integration for a smooth user experience

I'm incredibly proud of the results and grateful for the opportunity to work on such an innovative project.

If you're interested in learning more about how this technology works or exploring potential applications, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to discussions and collaborations in the exciting world of computer vision and augmented reality.
